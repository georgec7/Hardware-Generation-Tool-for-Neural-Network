# Hardware-Generation-Tool-for-Neural-Network
Performed design, verification, and synthesis of a data path that executed multiply and accumulate operation.
Combined this MAC unit with memories and control module to construct delay-optimized varieties of matrix-vector
multipliers.Extended the above idea to create software that flexibly generates hardware to accelerate the evaluation of layers of
fully-connected neural networks.
